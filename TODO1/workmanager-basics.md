Welcome to the second post of our WorkManager series. [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/) is an [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/) library that runs deferrable, guaranteed background work when the work’s constraints are satisfied. WorkManager is the current best practice for many types of background work. [In the first blog post](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/introducing-workmanager-2083bcfc4712), we talked about what WorkManager is and when to use WorkManager.

In this blog post, I’ll cover:

*   Defining your background task as work
*   Defining how specific work should run
*   Running your work
*   Using Chains for dependent work
*   Observing your work’s status

I’ll also explain what’s going on **behind the scenes** with WorkManager, so that you can make informed decisions about how to use it.

### Starting with an example

Let’s say you have an image editing app that lets you put filters on images and upload them to the web for the world to see. You want to create a series of background tasks that applies the filters, compresses the images, and then uploads them. In each phase, there is a constraint that needs to be checked — that there is sufficient battery when you are filtering the images, that you have enough storage space when compressing the images, and that you have a network connection when uploading the images.

The example, visualized

This is an example of a task that is:

*   **Deferrable**, because you don’t need it to happen immediately, and in fact might want to wait for some constraints to be met (such as waiting for a network connection).
*   Needs to be **guaranteed** to run, regardless of if the app exits, because your users would be pretty unhappy if their filtered images are never shared with the world!

These characteristics make our image filter and uploading tasks a perfect use case for WorkManager.

### Adding the WorkManager dependency

The code snippets in this blog post are in Kotlin, using the KTX library (KoTlin eXtensions). The KTX version of the library provides [extension functions](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/work/package-summary#extension-functions-summary) for more concise and idiomatic Kotlin. You can use the KTX version of WorkManager using this dependency:

```
dependencies {
 def work_version = "1.0.0-beta02"
 implementation "android.arch.work:work-runtime-ktx:$work_version"
}
```

You can find the latest version of the library [here](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/adding-components#workmanager). If you want to use the Java dependency, just remove the “-ktx”.

### Define what your work does

Let’s focus on how you execute one piece of work, before we get to chaining multiple tasks together. I’ll zoom in on the upload task. First, you’ll need to create your own implementation of the [`Worker`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Worker) class. I’ll call our class `UploadWorker`, and override the [`doWork()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Worker.html#doWork%28%29) method.

`Worker`s:

*   Define what your work actually **does**.
*   Accept inputs and produce outputs. Both inputs and outputs are represented as key, value pairs.
*   Always return a value representing success, failure, or retry.

Here’s an example showing how to implement a `Worker` that uploads an image:

```
class UploadWorker(appContext: Context, workerParams: WorkerParameters)
    : Worker(appContext, workerParams) {

    override fun doWork(): Result {
        try {
            // Get the input
            val imageUriInput = inputData.getString(Constants.KEY_IMAGE_URI)

            // Do the work
            val response = upload(imageUriInput)

            // Create the output of the work
            val imageResponse = response.body()
            val imgLink = imageResponse.data.link
            // workDataOf (part of KTX) converts a list of pairs to a [Data] object.
            val outputData = workDataOf(Constants.KEY_IMAGE_URI to imgLink)

            return Result.success(outputData)

        } catch (e: Exception) {
            return Result.failure()
        }
    }

    fun upload(imageUri: String): Response {
        TODO(“Webservice request code here”)
        // Webservice request code here; note this would need to be run
        // synchronously for reasons explained below.
    }

}
```

Two things to note:

*   The input and output are passed as [`Data`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Data), which is essentially a map of primitive types and arrays. `Data` objects are intended to be fairly small — there’s actually a limit on the total size that can be input/output. This is set by the [`MAX_DATA_BYTES`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Data.html#MAX_DATA_BYTES). If you need to pass more data in and out of your `Worker`, you should put your data elsewhere, such as a [Room database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/). As an example, I’m passing in the URI of the image above, and not the image itself.
*   In the code I show two return examples, [`Result.success()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/ListenableWorker.Result#success%28%29) and [`Result.failure()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/ListenableWorker.Result#failure%28%29). There’s also a [`Result.retry()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/ListenableWorker.Result#retry%28%29) option which will retry your work again at a later time.

### Define how your work should run

While a `Worker` defines what the work **does**, a [`WorkRequest`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/WorkRequest) defines **how and when work should be run**.

Here’s an example of creating a [`OneTimeWorkRequest`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/OneTimeWorkRequest) for your `UploadWorker`. It is also possible to have a repeating [`PeriodicWorkRequest`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/PeriodicWorkRequest):

```
// workDataOf (part of KTX) converts a list of pairs to a [Data] object.
val imageData = workDataOf(Constants.KEY_IMAGE_URI to imageUriString)

val uploadWorkRequest = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<UploadWorker>()
        .setInputData(imageData)
        .build()
```

This `WorkRequest` takes in the `imageData: Data` object as input and runs as soon as possible.

Let’s say the `UploadWork` shouldn’t always just run immediately — it should only run if the device has a network connection. You can do this by adding a [`Constraints`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Constraints.Builder) object. You can create a constraint like this:

```
val constraints = Constraints.Builder()
        .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.CONNECTED)
        .build()
```

Here’s an example of other supported constraints:

```
val constraints = Constraints.Builder()
        .setRequiresBatteryNotLow(true)
        .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.CONNECTED)
        .setRequiresCharging(true)
        .setRequiresStorageNotLow(true)
        .setRequiresDeviceIdle(true)
        .build()
```

Finally, remember `Result.retry()`? I said earlier that if a `Worker` returns `Result.retry()`, WorkManager will reschedule the work. You can customize the backoff criteria when you make a new `WorkRequest`. This allows you to define when the work should be retried.

The [backoff criteria](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/work/WorkRequest.Builder#setbackoffcriteria) is defined by two properties:

*   [**BackoffPolicy**](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/BackoffPolicy), which by default is exponential, but can be set to linear.
*   **Duration**, which defaults to 30 seconds.

The combined code for enqueuing your upload work, with constraints, input and a custom back-off policy, is:

```
// Create the Constraints
val constraints = Constraints.Builder()
        .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.CONNECTED)
        .build()

// Define the input
val imageData = workDataOf(Constants.KEY_IMAGE_URI to imageUriString)

// Bring it all together by creating the WorkRequest; this also sets the back off criteria
val uploadWorkRequest = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<UploadWorker>()
        .setInputData(imageData)
        .setConstraints(constraints)        
        .setBackoffCriteria(
                BackoffPolicy.LINEAR, 
                OneTimeWorkRequest.MIN_BACKOFF_MILLIS, 
                TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
        .build()
```

### Running work

This is all well and good, but you haven’t _actually_ _scheduled_ your work to run yet. Here’s the one line of code you need to tell WorkManager to schedule your work:

```
WorkManager.getInstance().enqueue(uploadWorkRequest)
```

You first need to get the instance of [`WorkManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/WorkManager), which is a singleton responsible for executing your work. Calling [`enqueue`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/WorkManager#enqueue%28androidx.work.WorkRequest%29) is what starts the whole process of `WorkManager` tracking and scheduling work.

### Behind the Scenes — How work runs

So what can you expect `WorkManager` to do for you? By default, `WorkManager` will:

*   Run your work **off of the main thread** (this assumes you are extending the `Worker` class, as shown above in `UploadWorker`).
*   **Guarantee** your work will execute (it won’t forget to run your work, even if you restart the device or the app exits).
*   Run according to **best practices for the user’s API level** (as described in the [previous article](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/introducing-workmanager-2083bcfc4712)).

Let’s explore how WorkManager ensures your work is run off of the main thread and is guaranteed to execute. Behind the scenes, WorkManager includes the following parts:

*   **Internal TaskExecutor**:  A single threaded [`Executor`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/Executor) that handles all the requests to enqueue work. If you’re not familiar with `Executors` you can read more about them [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/Executor).
*   **WorkManager database**: A local database that tracks all of the information and statuses of all of your work. This includes things like the current state of the work, the inputs and outputs to and from the work and any constraints on the work. This database is what enables WorkManager to guarantee your work will finish — if your user’s device restarts and work gets interrupted, all of the details of the work can be pulled from the database and the work can be restarted when the device boots up again.
*   **WorkerFactory****:  A default factory that creates instances of your `Worker`s. We’ll cover why and how to configure this in a future blog post.
*   **Default Executor****:  A default executor that runs your work unless you specify otherwise. This ensures that by default, your work runs synchronously and off of the main thread.

* These are parts that can be overridden to have different behaviors.

When you enqueue your `WorkRequest`:

1.  The Internal TaskExecutor immediately saves your `WorkRequest` info to the WorkManager database.
2.  Later, when the `Constraints` for the `WorkRequest` are met (which could be immediately), the Internal TaskExecutor tells the `WorkerFactory` to create a `Worker`.
3.  Then the default `Executor` calls your `Worker`’s `doWork()` method **off of the main thread.**

In this way, your work, by default, is both guaranteed to execute and to run off of the main thread.

Now if you want to use some other mechanism besides the default `Executor` to run your work, you can do so! There’s out of the box support for coroutines (`CoroutineWorker`) and RxJava ([`RxWorker`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/RxWorker)) as means of doing work.

Or you can specify exactly how work is executed by using [`ListenableWorker`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/ListenableWorker). `Worker` is actually an implementation of `ListenableWorker` that defaults to running your work on the default `Executor` and thus synchronously. So if you want full control over your work’s threading strategy or to run work asynchronously, you can subclass `ListenableWorker` (the details of this will be discussed in a later post).

The fact that WorkManager goes to the trouble of saving all of your work’s information into a database is what makes it perfect for tasks that need to be guaranteed to execute. This is also what makes WorkManager overkill for tasks that don’t need that guarantee and just need to be executed on a background thread. For example, let’s say you’ve downloaded an image and you want to change the color of parts of your UI based off of that image. This is work that should be run off of the main thread, but, because it’s directly related to the UI, does not need to continue if you close the app. So in a case like this, don’t use WorkManager — stick with something lighter weight like [Kotlin coroutines](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-coroutines/#0) or creating your own `Executor`.

### Using Chains for dependent work

Our filter example included more than just one task — we wanted to filter multiple images, then compress, then upload. If you want to run a series of `WorkRequest`s, one after the other or in parallel, you can use a [chain](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/advanced#chained). The example diagram shows a chain where you have three filter tasks run in parallel, followed by a compress task and an upload task, run in sequence:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*4VeMy6t8hLS1OyrM)

This is super easy with WorkManager. Assuming you have created all your WorkRequests with the appropriate constraints, the code looks like:

```
WorkManager.getInstance()
    .beginWith(Arrays.asList(
                             filterImageOneWorkRequest, 
                             filterImageTwoWorkRequest, 
                             filterImageThreeWorkRequest))
    .then(compressWorkRequest)
    .then(uploadWorkRequest)
    .enqueue()
```

The three filter-image `WorkRequest`s execute in parallel. Once all three filter `WorkRequests` are finished (and only if all three finish), the `compressWorkRequest` happens, followed by the `uploadWorkRequest`.

Another neat feature of chains is that the output of one `WorkRequest` is given as input to the next `WorkRequest`. So assuming you set your input and output data correctly, like I did above with my `UploadWorker` example, these values will get passed along automatically.

For handling output from the three filter work requests run parallel, you can use an [`InputMerger`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/InputMerger), specifically the [`ArrayCreatingInputMerger`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/ArrayCreatingInputMerger). This looks like:

```
val compressWorkRequest = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<CompressWorker>()
        .setInputMerger(ArrayCreatingInputMerger::class.java)
        .setConstraints(constraints)
        .build()
```

Notice that the `InputMerger` is added to the `compressWorkRequest`, not the three filter requests that are run in parallel.

Let’s assume that the output of each of the filter work requests is the key “KEY_IMAGE_URI” mapped to an image URI. What adding the `ArrayCreatingInputMerger` does is it takes the outputs from requests run in parallel and when those outputs have matching **keys**, it creates an array with all of the output values, mapped to the single key. Visualized this looks like:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Ft-4gVTZVjVtz6xIaEtNOg.png)

A visual of what an `ArrayCreatingInputMerger` does

So the input to `compressWorkRequest` will end up being the pair of “KEY_IMAGE_URI” mapped to an array of filtered image URIs.

### Observing your WorkRequest status

The easiest way to observe work is by using the [`LiveData`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/LiveData) class. If you’re not familiar with `LiveData`, it’s a lifecycle-aware observable data holder — and it’s described in more detail [here](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata).

Calling [`getWorkInfoByIdLiveData`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/WorkManager.html#getWorkInfoById%28java.util.UUID%29) returns a `LiveData` of [`WorkInfo`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/WorkInfo). `WorkInfo` includes the output data and an enum representing the state of the work. When the work finishes successfully, its’ [`State`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/work/State) is `SUCCEEDED`. So, for example, you could automatically display that image when the work is done by writing some observation code like:

```
// In your UI (activity, fragment, etc)
WorkManager.getInstance().getWorkInfoByIdLiveData(uploadWorkRequest.id)
        .observe(lifecycleOwner, Observer { workInfo ->
            // Check if the current work's state is "successfully finished"
            if (workInfo != null && workInfo.state == WorkInfo.State.SUCCEEDED) {
                displayImage(workInfo.outputData.getString(KEY_IMAGE_URI))
            }
        })
```

A few things to note:

*   Each `WorkRequest` has a [unique id](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/WorkRequest.html#getId%28%29) and that unique id is one way to look up the associated `WorkInfo`.
*   The ability to observe and be notified when the `WorkInfo` changes is a feature provided by `LiveData`.

Work has a lifecycle, represented by different [`State`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/work/State)s. When observing the `LiveData<WorkInfo>` you’ll see those states; for example you might see:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ygDDGGdiBm8_c2_u3rXWkQ.png)

The “happy path” or work States

The “happy path” of states that work goes through are:

1.  `BLOCKED` : This state occurs only if the work is in a chain and is not the next work in the chain.
2.  `ENQUEUED` : Work enters this state as soon as the work is next in the chain of work and eligible to run. This work may still be waiting on `Constraint`s to be met.
3.  `RUNNING` : In this state, the work is actively executing. For `Worker`s, this means the `doWork()` method has been called.
4.  `SUCCEEDED` : Work enters this terminal state when `doWork()` returns `Result.success()`.

Now when the work is `RUNNING`, you might call `Result.retry()`. This will cause the work to go back to `ENQUEUED`. The work can also be `CANCELLED` at any point.

If the work result is a `Result.failure()` instead of a success, its state will end in `FAILED`. The full flowchart of states therefore looks like this:

### Conclusion

That’s the basics of the WorkManager API. Using the snippets we just covered you can now:

*   Create `Worker`s with input and output.
*   Configure how your `Worker`s will run, using `WorkRequest`s, `Constraint`s, starting input and back off policies.
*   Enqueue `WorkRequest`s.
*   Understand what `WorkManager` does under the hood, by default, in respect to threading and guaranteed execution.
*   Create complex chains of interdependent work, running both sequentially and in parallel.
*   Observe your `WorkRequest`s status using `WorkInfo`.
